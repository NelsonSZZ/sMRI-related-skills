# Data Types

In Python🐍 there are different kinds of data that can be given to a variable. It is important to understand
these data types well enough to be able to use other peoples' tools or programs.

* A variable is whatever you assign it with.
* A string (e.g., `Nelson`) or set of letters `hihi`.
* Integer are numbers (e.g., `1`, `100`)
* Flaot are numbers with decimals (e.g., `1.1`, `100.1`)
* List `[]` are used to list intergers (e.g., `[1, 100, 200]`)
* Dictionary `{}` has names with each item (e.g., `{'age' : '24', 'name': 'Nelson'}`).
