# Intro
In Python🐍 there are different kinds of data that can be given to a variable. It is important to understand these data types well enough to be able to use other peoples' tools or programs.

## Data Types
* A variable is whatever you assign it with.
* A string (e.g., `Nelson`) or set of letters `hihi`.
* Integer are numbers (e.g., `1`, `100`)
* Flaot are numbers with decimals (e.g., `1.1`, `100.1`)
* List `[]` are a collection of data types (e.g., `['haha', 'nelson', 'Ben']`)
* Dictionary `{}` has a key and a value respectively (e.g., `{'age' : '24', 'name': 'Nelson'}`).

## Slicing 
Slicing is an operation that lets you extract a sequence portion of a sequence

* To add a integer into a list with strings, we have to use `'variable name'.append()`.
