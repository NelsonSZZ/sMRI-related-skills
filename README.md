# 🧠 Structural_MRI_Learning Process
This whole page is primarily my notes for my learning - in linux commands and Free surfer. It is still in progress and will eventually be a more comprehensive resource area for myself as a reference.

## 🐧[Linux](https://github.com/NelsonSZZ/Structural_MRI_Notes/tree/1cb1b53c096db4bc9a8dc2ca0035e925102846c8/Linux)
This repository is an example of me learning Linux. I first started off with simple bash commands, and then will proceed onto Python🐍 pipelines for sMRI.
